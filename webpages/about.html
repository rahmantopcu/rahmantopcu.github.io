                Hello, my name is Rahman and I'm a student with a keen interest towards computer programming and game development.
                Ever since I was a small child, I've been fascinated with how people use technology to create immersive experiences and share them on the internet.
                <br><br>
                I first delve into the world of programming when I got bored during the Pandemic.
                The idea of writing code and seeing it manifest on the screen really amused me during the boring quarantine.
                And it kept on amusing me even after the quarantine.
                <br><br>
                My first programming language was C# but I learned Python, JavaScript and a little bit of Java as well.
                I've been constantly challenging myself to hone my skills and tackle greater and more complex projects.
                <br><br>
                I've always desired to create interactive, capturing worlds and share them on the internet for anyone to play.
                So as my interest for programming languages grew, I started to experiment with game development.
                I'm using Unity at the moment but I also have some experience working with Godot.
                <br><br>
                In the future, I hope to pursue a career in the tech industry, where I can keep exploring my passion for programming and game development. 
                I am excited to see where this journey will take me and the amazing things I can hopefully accomplish along the way. 
                Thank you for taking the time to visit my website - I look forward to connecting with people and sharing more of my projects on this site! 
                <br><br>
